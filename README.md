This synthetic dataset was generated by exploiting the graphic engine of *Grand Theft Auto V*. There are 538 individuals captured in several urban scenarios with a total of 19 different camera positions. Every pedestrian has been recorded at least by 2 cameras with an average of 3.5 up to 5 cameras. The video sequences have been recorded both during day and night, with different kinds of weather ( blizzard, rain, clear). The pedestrians, therefore, could have been recorded with different illumination and weather settings. The assumption is that each identity maintains the same clothing in all the videos. The total number of bounding boxes is 94312 and it ranges from 29 to 496 for each pedestrian. For more statistics you can see [this](https://github.com/RoboTuan/Pedestrian_reID/blob/main/Peds/statistics.csv) file. 

To simulate a realistic scenario, the generated bounding boxes are not "perfect" an can include bodyparts of other peds or entire peds in the background. The bounding boxes also include occlusion by objects or they are recorded even if they are far away from the camera and the scenarios are relatively crowded. Below there are some examples.

Some of the individuals who share similar clothes, even if they represent different identities. This happpens especially for those who wear a uniform or a suit and in low illumination settings. The picture below shows this phenomenon.
